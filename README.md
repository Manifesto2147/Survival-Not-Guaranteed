## üõ†Ô∏è Manifest-Driven Development System

This modpack employs a cutting-edge manifest-driven CI/CD system for reliable, automated distribution:

- **üìã Manifest Authority**: `modrinth.index.json` is the single source of truth for all mod information
- **üîÑ Fresh CI Builds**: Every release downloads all 140+ mods fresh and rebuilds the .mrpack from scratch
- **‚úÖ Zero Drift**: Eliminates version mismatches between development and distribution
- **üõ°Ô∏è Legal Compliance**: All mods downloaded from official Modrinth sources only
- **üéØ Dungeons & Taverns**: Server-only mods properly handled and distributed
- **‚ö° Instant Updates**: Push manifest changes, get automatic releases with complete mod validation

### Developer Workflow (Manifest-First)

```bash
# Update the manifest with new/changed mods
vim modrinth.index.json

# Test the manifest builds correctly
./build.sh

# Commit and push changes (no .mrpack files needed)
git add modrinth.index.json CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "Add new mods and update manifest"
git push origin main  # Triggers automated CI/CD

# CI automatically:
# 1. Downloads all 140+ mods from manifest
# 2. Builds fresh .mrpack with exact version sync
# 3. Distributes to GitHub and Modrinth
```
