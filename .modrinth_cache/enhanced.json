More mods and features are planned. For now, treat this modpack as a ready-to-install modpack for EnhancedCraft.\n\n### Open Source\nEnhanced (and most of the included mods) are open source. Any recommendations or questions are appreciated! Issues can be reported [here](https://github.com/spxctreofficial/enhanced-modpack/issues).\n\n### FAQ\n\n> **Q:** Will my performance suffer compared to [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized)?\n>\n> **A:** Most of the essential mods included in Fabulously Optimized are also included in this modpack. That means that, while there may be a few more obscure mods included with Fabulously Optimized, performance will be largely identical and unnoticeable.\n\n> **Q:** How do I install this modpack?\n>\n> **Modrinth:** [Tutorial](https://docs.modrinth.com/docs/modpacks/playing_modpacks/)\n\n> **Q:** What mod loader is this modpack built for?\n>\n> **A:** Fabric. (Quilt should technically work with most of these mods, but may break later down the line as Quilt diverges from the Fabric Project).","body_url":null,"published":"2022-08-22T04:44:51.400381Z","updated":"2022-12-26T01:07:38.070220Z","approved":null,"queued":null,"status":"approved","requested_status":null,"moderator_message":null,"license":{"id":"GPL-3.0-only","name":"GNU General Public License v3.0 only","url":null},"downloads":923,"followers":4,"categories":["adventure","combat","multiplayer"],"additional_categories":["optimization"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["BpoPNSLK","SInjbvAm","nEp5Pguq","GbA1cYb2","YT1DsvML"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/swUNYfhk/857d34cf5dc5d6ab7379d57a7bc4a0f2f270e52f_96.webp","issues_url":"https://github.com/spxctreofficial/enhanced-modpack/issues","source_url":"https://github.com/spxctreofficial/enhanced-modpack","wiki_url":null,"discord_url":null,"donation_urls":[],"gallery":[],"color":11182816,"thread_id":"swUNYfhk","monetization_status":"monetized"}
