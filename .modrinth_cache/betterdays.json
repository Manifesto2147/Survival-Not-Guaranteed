However, due to being too\nbusy to update to 1.16.5,\n[Hourglass](https://github.com/DuckyCrayfish/hourglass) mod was created. Now\nHourglass hasn't received any updates in nearly a year, plus there are new\nfeatures that needed added. I've revived Better days to update for not only\n1.19 and 1.20, but also bring all the features to <u>both</u> **Forge and Fabric**.\n\n1.19+ is a fork of Hourglass mod, with new features and some functionality removed.\n\n1.18.2 is a backport for both Forge and Fabric that contains all of the 1.19+ features and bug fixes.\n\n### Differences from Hourglass Mod\n * Commands removed.\n * Forge only configuration screen removed.\n * Syncing config updates with client. Now requires a restart.\n * Added better support for Serene Seasons\n\n## Features\n\nThis mod (optionally) **replaces the vanilla sleep functionality with a smooth and natural transition\nto morning** by accelerating the passage of time while you're in bed. In multiplayer, time will pass\nfaster depending on the percentage of players who are currently sleeping. This removes the need for\nany sleep voting system or player threshold, as any number of players can have an impact on the\nduration of the night.\n\nBetter Days allows for **customization of the day-night cycle duration**, and can control day and night\nspeed independently. Rather than the vanilla duration of 20 minutes, you can slow down time to make\na day in Minecraft last as long as a day in real life, or speed up the passage of nights for a more\nforgiving experience.\n\nBetter Days also provides a number of **time effects** that may speed up the progression of various\nelements in Minecraft to match the current speed of time. Some examples include crop growth, grass\ngrowth, weather, potion effects, furnaces, hoppers, etc. Most of these time effects are disabled by\ndefault but can be enabled by setting their associated [config options](#configuration).\n\n## Compatibility\n\nBetter Days is compatible with the following mods:\n\n* [Homeostatic](https://modrinth.com/mod/homeostatic)\n* [Ready Player Fun](https://modrinth.com/mod/ready-player-fun)\n* [Comforts](https://modrinth.com/mod/comforts)\n* [Sleep Warp](https://modrinth.com/mod/sleep-warp)\n  * If mod is installed, sleep system is disabled.\n* [Fabric Seasons](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-seasons)\n* [Serene Seasons](https://modrinth.com/mod/serene-seasons)\n* [Enhanced Celestials](https://modrinth.com/mod/enhanced-celestials)\n* [Quark](https://modrinth.com/mod/quark)\n  * The Improved Sleeping module of Quark interferes with the sleep feature of Better Days.\n    [See note below.](#sleep-vote-mods)  \n  * The \"Nerf Clock\" Quark option breaks the bed clock in Better Days. Either the Quark tweak should\n    be disabled or the Better Days Bed Clock should be disabled via the `displayBedClock` config.\n* [Nomadic Tents](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nomadic-tents)\n  * Better Days is compatible with this mod. However, sleep causes an extra full day cycle to pass\n    after waking.\n* [The Hordes](https://modrinth.com/mod/the-hordes)\n  * Better Days is compatible with this mod. However, you MUST set hordeEventByPlayerTime = false or it will not work at all.\n\n#### Sleep Vote Mods\n\nBetter Days is compatible with mods that enable sleep voting or have sleep percentage systems like\nQuark and Morpheus, but they conflict with the sleep feature of this mod. These features should\neither be disabled in their corresponding mods, or the sleep feature in Better Days should be disabled.\nThe sleep feature can be disabled via command or file by modifying the `enableSleepFeature` option.\n\n#### Other Compatibility Notes\n\nThe Overworld is currently the only dimension supported. However, most dimensions in Minecraft\n(including custom dimensions) derive their time information from the Overworld and will therefore\nelapse time at the same rate.\n\nThis mod does not save data to world files and can safely be safely removed from a Minecraft installation.","body_url":null,"published":"2023-07-27T22:05:48.640506Z","updated":"2025-04-10T17:54:27.717126Z","approved":"2023-07-30T03:26:18.689779Z","queued":"2023-07-28T20:14:40.427751Z","status":"approved","requested_status":"approved","moderator_message":null,"license":{"id":"LGPL-3.0-or-later","name":"GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 only","url":"https://github.com/wendall911/BetterDays/blob/1.19.2/LICENSE"},"downloads":230225,"followers":294,"categories":["game-mechanics","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["ppTvMkcQ","6QftivWi","TddICzRK","VaNOkVJS","VdjYMDVE","ibKtyTIG","9oJK1FwS","Dghw70lA","qFEeN1Wp","o8hjQvLV","wywWx0Ub","xUcSpIZd","Mqwb9p92","TzICWvRb","JzqHlPKT","5hMNExru","TSERS24K","5yfcESSM","Vz8xARIh","e1jJjulH","chsCXxGC","byzCvNSG","5doFox3Y","ftsoxL1c","EC94faYu","LmJGq8Ff","7eS9eKJN","McOXQE2j","MSEo61mh","CEKbQT8h","IOxiu3gK","2EB4O0kI","R6IsBztY","QNhCPEEp","SDmq2hzt","rP0FLAoT","YgNXRO7d","vF9W1o3N","qn4IfUVj","nQlHeruW","niRfpLxC","jucWHRBG","CWvq1YC3","vGAvbEzd","vlF0ze6H","oJv5gnwY","RlnttnHw","kJHxJxjM","T6V583JM","jzG7tvOS","tOVRc3Kq","Q43766Y7","3b3TxUFb","G5qA9aia","ITetSBkZ","OQgQhAgg","k6Si34c8","Pj5Qyqa9","2PydmNtZ","QlpGYGPV","5RVVPZvB","P9DX2WaT","jUwhtX5C","Q4TNWg1f","DvikdE88","YCkwRV1a","bkzXIlVC","ivr6Igde","RaPb1u7s","jg4LV0PU","DDKR5guu","J712m5Di","cDFfGK5p","51R2shTf","vBPw1HR6","7hKBiPWL","qCHel9SW","tDStMRRk","KT2XGPaY","js4xWs8H","41R14ee5","Mj9XkfTw","TiN14Sw5","XvMPQ3pf"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tPLE214j/a808b6d89eddc9acc0f9c99c67f47643502afa34_96.webp","issues_url":"https://github.com/wendall911/BetterDays/issues","source_url":"https://github.com/wendall911/BetterDays","wiki_url":"https://github.com/wendall911/BetterDays/wiki","discord_url":null,"donation_urls":[{"id":"github","platform":"Github","url":"https://github.com/sponsors/wendall911"},{"id":"ko-fi","platform":"Ko-fi","url":"https://ko-fi.com/wendall911"}],"gallery":[],"color":4082787,"thread_id":"tPLE214j","monetization_status":"monetized"}
