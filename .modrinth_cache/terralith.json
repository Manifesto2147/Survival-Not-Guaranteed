There are also new terrain types: canyons, shattered biomes, floating islands, deep ocean trenches, and much, much more.\n\n**Yellowstone** is one of Terralith's staple biomes - a simple and beautiful landscape, based on the real life US National Park. Among the list of realistic biomes are **Yosemite Cliffs**, **Shield**, and many more depending on what you're looking for in a biome. **Highlands** and its variants offer a flat surface to create on - builders can imagine anything from huge mega cities to small simple cottages. Adventurers can explore the breath-taking **Volcanic Peaks** and discover the beautiful **Desert Oases**.\n\nWhile realistic biomes can remind us of the beautiful planet we live on, Terralith offers a plunge into the world of fantasy as well. Adventurers can wander through the purple and mystical **Moonlight Grove** and **Amethyst Rainforest**, or climb the unforgiving cliffs of the **Scarlet Mountains**. If determined, sailers can find the mysterious **Mirage Isles**, or even the elusive and nostalgic **Alpha Islands**. Terralith encourages imagination to run wild here.\n\nIf you feel the surface is too face, have no fear - custom caves lurk beneath your feet! Similar to Minecraft's Lush Cave, the **Underground Jungle** is full of foliage, and rarely some old abandoned houses. Other caves, like **Infested** and **Fungal Caves** are overgrown with spiders and fungi! If you dig super deep, you could stumble upon a sister to the Deep Dark: the **Frostfire Caves** are dangerous and menacing. Beware!\n\n### Structures\nTo tie all of Terralith's magnificent biomes together are it's structures. The ominous tall **Spire** pierces the sky in the iciest biomes. Rarely, you can find **Fortified Villages** in the plains and desert - the villagers have progressed quite far as a society! Finally, if you find yourself lost at night, cold and hungry, you might stumble into the warm protection of the simple Glacial Hut.\n__ __\n\n[![Patron Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786738-7baefaf8-267f-41b6-8ac5-53cc4bd5707e.png \"Join our Patreon!\")](https://www.patreon.com/stardustlabs)\n\n[![Bisect Hosting Ad](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63272345/224786219-f87f21d2-fb51-4d78-82df-a16e83fe25c9.png \"Use code STARDUST\")](https://www.bisecthosting.com/stardust)\n    ","body_url":null,"published":"2022-11-13T21:48:54.507121Z","updated":"2025-06-30T20:13:31.768543Z","approved":"2022-11-23T01:21:11.804610Z","queued":null,"status":"approved","requested_status":null,"moderator_message":null,"license":{"id":"LicenseRef-Stardust-Labs-License","name":"","url":"https://github.com/Stardust-Labs-MC/license/blob/main/license.txt"},"downloads":5585605,"followers":4920,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"loaders":["datapack","fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["Q9qUUqA7","Wd3Co0mZ","81tshMIZ","Xf5mFGCS","jUK1mCz3","1latp88m","pNFzTzQd","mLdNNka6","K3S6BASh","aYOzrVFZ","Y4i2gvLB","D0hKeWDQ","JT2esX5R","8N8lLvTW","34PhE3zd","2w1uZoRC","PNByHzei","WZvndtxX","UJtMNPNx","Rq2BBA8A","hYoo0DKV","CDrDiFNK","qFd4s3fV","FOe2l0tx","IWVbiEbl","1hOeraaL","4KrRTVvQ","WgDuoe1K","xm11wemG","FgvUosFH","zA1qYB0L","6DoFR4md","owDSctxm","rWmFwtGy","IA4tbVrS","5k90Bexh","WeYhEb5d","Mm6TmSwo","rEF3UnUI","GufHTWz8","YmXuNSUM","YFeeBgIL","4LsxILTH","81gyNzd0","tnavs2WP","PcYlKx8w","lQreFvOm","MuJMtPGQ","urbokcOc","vGKEdR1w","uG75eHfz","D7rFyTAc","plRDn5uz","BhiTK9tz","o7SunBER"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/1959d924a1088944bbf07a06ba523726112d7e7a_96.webp","issues_url":"https://github.com/Stardust-Labs-MC/Terralith/issues","source_url":"https://github.com/Stardust-Labs-MC/Terralith","wiki_url":"https://stardustlabs.miraheze.org/wiki/Terralith","discord_url":"https://discord.gg/stardustlabs","donation_urls":[{"id":"ko-fi","platform":"Ko-fi","url":"https://ko-fi.com/stardustlabs"},{"id":"patreon","platform":"Patreon","url":"https://patreon.com/stardustlabs"}],"gallery":[{"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/images/4957da7c3da1386fb12b76001a2321be7b2ff9bc_350.webp","raw_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/images/e66c54081b2abbdeb6dfdb0bde26123f8641176c.jpeg","featured":false,"title":null,"description":null,"created":"2022-11-13T21:53:31.044672Z","ordering":0},{"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/images/c4168f5d280c85e0e3d050bb8f3bc776fd0762d4_350.webp","raw_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/images/be7daf4d0023204165ab00cfa7815f8068bc951b.jpeg","featured":false,"title":null,"description":null,"created":"2022-11-13T21:53:29.371658Z","ordering":0},{"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/images/c5b10dfed4a506559d2e2081821e99e1f5b66794_350.webp","raw_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/8oi3bsk5/images/8eb1319d93336ca3ac29578e029459c3c0ec5132.jpeg","featured":false,"title":null,"description":null,"created":"2022-11-13T21:53:32.559416Z","ordering":0}],"color":4996660,"thread_id":"8oi3bsk5","monetization_status":"monetized"}
