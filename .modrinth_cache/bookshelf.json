What do I do?\nYou have to enable \"EnableHopperSupport\" and/or \"EnableDropperSupport\" in the config!\n*(Note that it is quite resource intensive if you have too many bookshelves)*\n\n### Enchantment Table Boosting does not work, and there are no errors, and I've already enabled it in the config, why is that?\nIf you are running Minecraft version 1.8 - 1.10.2, unfortunately, enchantment table boosting feature is unsupported on these versions.<br>\nIf you are running Minecraft version 1.11 or above, double check your settings and permissions or contact me!\n\n### The shift + pick block with NBT function does not work, I already gave myself permission, what's wrong?\nCurrently, the feature is only tested in Minecraft 1.15+. If it doesn't work in another version, it is normal and is being worked on. Thank you for being patient!\n\n### How is the Enchantment Table Boosting calculated?\nCheck out the wiki page: https://github.com/LOOHP/Bookshelf/wiki/Enchantment-Table-Boosting\n\n## API\n**Bookshelf does provide an API for developers to customize or use its functions**\n- When hoppers or hopper minecarts exchange items with bookshelves **InventoryMoveItemEvent**will fire, just listen to it just like any other bukkit events\n- When a player opens or closes a bookshelf, **PlayerOpenBookshelfEvent** or **PlayerCloseBookshelfEvent** will fire. If a player does not have permission to access that bookshelf (includes protection from other plugins, it will fire as _cancelled_ (After priority LOWEST)\n**https://github.com/LOOHP/Bookshelf/tree/master/src/main/java/com/loohp/bookshelf/API**<br>\nMore info through the link above\n\n## Permissions\nbookshelf.use - Allow players to use a bookshelf [default: false]\nbookshelf.reload - Reload the plugin [default: op]\nbookshelf.copynbt - Allows you to shift-middle-click to copy bookshelf with items inside in creative [default: op]\nbookshelf.update - Allow you to receive update messages [default: op]\n\n## Default Config\n**[Latest Config with Descriptions](https://github.com/LOOHP/Bookshelf/blob/master/common/src/main/resources/config.yml)**\n\n## Limitations\n- Bookshelves do not output a redstone signal via a redstone comparator, I will attempt to add that *once I find a method that works :/*\n- Bookshelves transactions are not picked up by block loggers such as coreprotect, I will try to add that or create my own logging system in the future.\n\n## Data usage\nUsage statistics at https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/InteractiveChat will be visible to the public with your server included in the statistics.
