You will easily find all of its content on your own without requiring a wiki or guide, especially with each item being explained ingame! Get out there and do some digging!\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n**\"Does <x> work with Spigot/Paper/Purpur/etc...\"**\nIf you're having trouble with it on one of those, probably not.
