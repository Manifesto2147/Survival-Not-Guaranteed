I plan on using the batteries for machines and to make this mod more tech based.\n> Please don't comment on the horrendous textures of this mod. I did them and I suck at drawing.\n> When I will add entities and block entities, the models will be so much worse than the textures beacause I am not an graphic or 3D designer.\n\n# Killstreak Sword\n   \n![Killstreak Sword Phases](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uqbWxqgh/images/8270478671120bd41dbc729ac5c1cab0ec163d4c.png)\n\n## Stats\n|Phase Number|Damage Bonus|Kill Counts|\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n|1 | 2.3 | 0 - 5 |\n|2 | 3.5| 6 - 15|\n|3 | 4.7 | 16 - 25 |\n|4 |5.7 | 26 - 30 |\n|5 |7 | 31 - 35 |\n|6 |8.7 | 36 - 45 |\n|7 |10 | 46 - 50 |\n|8 |-2 | 51 - 60 |\n|9 |16.7 |61 - 75 |\n|10 |19.75 | 76+ |\n\n## Overkills\nWhen the kill count goes over the maximum count(in the mod it is 100), the kills go to the overkills. This count doesn't do anything special and it is there just for flexing. Maybe, in the future, there will be more phases, therefore, there the maximum kill count will be higher.\n\n","body_url":null,"published":"2025-06-13T11:56:22.531209Z","updated":"2025-06-22T21:34:47.111732Z","approved":"2025-06-21T01:12:58.270827Z","queued":"2025-06-13T12:34:13.468380Z","status":"approved","requested_status":"approved","moderator_message":null,"license":{"id":"MIT","name":"MIT License","url":null},"downloads":24,"followers":0,"categories":["equipment"],"additional_categories":["technology"],"loaders":["neoforge"],"versions":["uwsDd15P","ETeaADFn"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uqbWxqgh/e78bbc156f570b28259874f582e6a3a46074e732_96.webp","issues_url":"https://github.com/MeFiddzy/LMOD/issues","source_url":"https://github.com/MeFiddzy/LMOD","wiki_url":null,"discord_url":null,"donation_urls":[],"gallery":[{"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uqbWxqgh/images/626c15964b8c37744ef125aaf5b76d55c944f9c6_350.webp","raw_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uqbWxqgh/images/626c15964b8c37744ef125aaf5b76d55c944f9c6.png","featured":false,"title":"Dust empowerer","description":"The dust empowerer converting tough powder into enpowerment powder","created":"2025-06-13T12:20:17.269328Z","ordering":0},{"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uqbWxqgh/images/8270478671120bd41dbc729ac5c1cab0ec163d4c_350.webp","raw_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uqbWxqgh/images/8270478671120bd41dbc729ac5c1cab0ec163d4c.png","featured":true,"title":"Killstreak Sword Phases","description":"All of the phases of the killstreak sword.","created":"2025-06-13T12:18:06.136799Z","ordering":0},{"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uqbWxqgh/images/f2b749bcdfdc4dadb755c92a04dab99285f416b6_350.webp","raw_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uqbWxqgh/images/f2b749bcdfdc4dadb755c92a04dab99285f416b6.png","featured":false,"title":"Permanent Enpowerer","description":null,"created":"2025-06-13T12:21:16.286076Z","ordering":0}],"color":13661191,"thread_id":"nbcT5x18","monetization_status":"monetized"}
