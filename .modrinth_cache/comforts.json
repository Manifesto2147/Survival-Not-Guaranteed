Comes in 16 different colors!","body":"Comforts is a mod that adds sleeping bags and hammocks to Minecraft. These items can be used just\nlike beds except they do not set a player's spawn point on use, safely preserving a player's spawn\npoint at their home base. Just like beds, they also come in 16 different colors! The difference is\nthat sleeping bags can be stacked and are more convenient to use on adventures and hammocks are like\nan inverse bed, turning day to night.\n\n## Features\n\n### Sleeping Bag\nThe recipe for the sleeping bag is simply three pieces of matching color wool in a straight line.\n\n**1.21 and above**\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/7WZn6Dn/sleeping-bag-recipes.gif)\n\n**1.20.6 and

Hammock\nThe recipe for the hammock cloth is simply a piece of colored wool in the center, sticks to the top\nand bottom, and the rest of the slots are strings.\n\n**1.21 and
