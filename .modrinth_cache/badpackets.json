Even then there are more complicated things like game object id sync that this mod doesn't handle which makes it unrealistic to support in the first place.","body_url":null,"published":"2022-04-21T06:37:33.035188Z","updated":"2025-06-19T16:04:04.553251Z","approved":"2022-04-21T06:37:33.035188Z","queued":null,"status":"approved","requested_status":null,"moderator_message":null,"license":{"id":"Apache-2.0","name":"Apache License 2.0","url":null},"downloads":3944824,"followers":1138,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["1AcgR5SK","HsT4DFo1","1Hbu2VKC","VAtfgT4j","CrA8IgxU","mtcdPvG3","Sbpp5LIv","DgbZObPH","pNwyuhpf","79fychO4","vH59yR5Z","UsEYm0lW","AifWRdyF","FVH3CFm8","VFUaifUX","tJ3Zo8XL","9hA9pLHz","leB6oPZT","M4Yx6u7G","ivJ0srK8","DQ3ykOKy","R4VZLscL","7W1EZ62z","BwFS3gJU","cbwYwlkL","BTK3ZWby","dcVcnZ7u","tlVfTMfA","7Y5NcPRW","VTOW8XR6","y3ePCCWU","1rvHfeKp","JjLWLyDz","aXZqpNgH","Bz8FfSYz","vkkhLNyf","CbkPVEhy","SvSHT7FN","TKfXKkni","V9mKHSKL","mvzSGXpX","gh1sFs8A","yQZfiKnD","M5H8gKAX","9Z4vv7Rw","awF2Oswk","Qlt6D4vq","sMwC8oGF","fHVsueQX","riqsK6Al","g9Fep1ah","IdqILfxP","LQPjmR6D","5yA32jcG","UYxT6HjU","YVPHzQSG","wtnMg6x5","QeK88m3Z","U4jrxsVz","ac4a1Xj7","n8slpshH","Ua3Y89qt","c4qUyPqh","ZKydYmib","jyFCivlP","Om734hK8","TrWvbYAw","cJeV31is","51Q6yUsH","vZWHaqvo","Cn58uH65","PXf9r02i","hjhT2sMz","RNyYl9M3","pkojjviM","Luy2S9Fr","xc3VAnhB"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ftdbN0KK/icon.png","issues_url":"https://github.com/badasintended/badpackets/issues","source_url":"https://github.com/badasintended/badpackets","wiki_url":null,"discord_url":"https://bai.lol/discord","donation_urls":[],"gallery":[],"color":12897444,"thread_id":"ftdbN0KK","monetization_status":"monetized"}
