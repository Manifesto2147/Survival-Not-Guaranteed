A complete upgrade to Minecraft's SFX with over 170 new sound effects for UIs, items, blocks and more.","body":"[![](https://cdn.imb11.dev/mineblock%20badge_64h.png)](https://discord.imb11.dev/)\n\n### **It's what it says on the tin.**\n\nSounds is a mod that adds a variety of new sound effects to the game, whilst improving existing ones that didn't quite fit. It's a game-changer, it makes vanilla feel incomplete in comparison.\n\nThe mod is also a spiritual continuation of ExtraSounds, Auditory and QualitySounds; the majority of features from these mods have been expanded upon to be highly configurable.\n\n**Requires [M.R.U](https://modrinth.com/mod/mru) & [Yet Another Config Lib](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl)**\n\n## Features\n- **Includes over 170 SFX improvements** which span across the entire game, such as UI, chat messages, in-game actions and block sounds.\n- **High quality** sound effects sourced from [Zapsplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/) and hand-tweaked for the best SFX experience.\n- **Fully client-side only**, no need to install on the server!\n- **Highly customizable**, you can change the sounds events used, and even tweak the dynamic block and item sounds through resource packs, especially useful for creating addons for content mods.'\n\n<iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"520px\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9H55Nxoc0uk\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n## Configuration\nAs mentioned, Sounds is **highly customizable** - the simple effects can be edited either through the configuration found in the `config/sounds/` folder of your game instance, or though the configuration screen.\n\n*[Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) is required to access the configuration screen for the Fabric version of the mod.*\n\n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ZouiUX7t/images/1e6b01c27e463a9ab8c4ec1306a9820eece3cd3b.png)\n\n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ZouiUX7t/images/a5b5f083b86a662bda4031e00778933fc1cbc8c1.png)\n\n### Adding support for modded content\n\nRefer to the [Sounds Documentation](https://docs.imb11.dev/sounds/) for more information on creating dynamic sound definitions for items, screens and blocks.\n\n<small>\n\nCustom sound effects obtained from [Zapsplat](https://www.zapsplat.com) under ZapSplat Standard License for Gold Members.\n\nBy using my mods, you agree to the [End User License Agreement](https://legal.imb11.dev/mods/eula).
