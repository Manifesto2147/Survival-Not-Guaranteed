The glint renders at full strength regardless of lighting, this makes the glint extremely visible in the dark while the item that the glint is on is not visible.\n2. The glint adds its own color to the color of the item beneath it. This causes items to appear washed out.\n\n## How does Spice address this?\n\nSpice modifies the blend settings used by the enchantment glint shaders. In particular, it sets the blend factor of the glint to the color of the thing it is being applied to. The end result is that bright items receive strong glints and dark items receive weak glints. This has a contrast-increasing effect on the item and takes light levels into consideration. The glint looks much nicer in low-light environments and items no longer appear washed out.\n\n## Spice quirks\n\nSince reducing the glint alpha would cause it to look terrible due to the way blending is applied, the glint alpha setting has been replaced by a **hue rotation.** This means that you can change the color of the glint without needing to swap out your resource pack.\n\nA glint alpha of 0% corresponds to a hue rotation of 0 degrees and a glint alpha of 100% corresponds to a hue rotation of 360 degrees. The following values roughly correspond to the following colors:\n\n0% -> purple  \n16% -> red  \n33% -> yellow  \n50% -> green  \n66% -> cyan  \n83% -> blue  \n100% -> purple (same as 0%)\n\nSpice also fixes an unrelated issue with fog being incorrectly applied to armor.\n\nClick [here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=R5t09pEk5Fg) to see a short demonstration.","body_url":null,"published":"2023-06-06T03:43:18.244509Z","updated":"2024-01-25T19:06:36.067147Z","approved":"2023-06-06T20:23:48.572634Z","queued":"2023-06-06T16:55:10.222826Z","status":"archived","requested_status":"approved","moderator_message":null,"license":{"id":"LicenseRef-All-Rights-Reserved","name":"","url":null},"downloads":1192,"followers":15,"categories":["core-shaders","tweaks"],"additional_categories":[],"loaders":["minecraft"],"versions":["NH86fhRF","ECtRcac4","rCl5zth2"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4IFGavUP/8f252e018ab0da3e938b6a239d2439f12e70a097_96.webp","issues_url":null,"source_url":null,"wiki_url":null,"discord_url":null,"donation_urls":[],"gallery":[{"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4IFGavUP/images/b254844d5a487e0ddefd8cc35d02f15285dbbaaf_350.webp","raw_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4IFGavUP/images/b254844d5a487e0ddefd8cc35d02f15285dbbaaf.png","featured":true,"title":"Day armor","description":null,"created":"2023-06-06T16:47:19.007701Z","ordering":0},{"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4IFGavUP/images/21af19c6efe85bfedf2db890880945822fb10637_350.webp","raw_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4IFGavUP/images/21af19c6efe85bfedf2db890880945822fb10637.png","featured":false,"title":"Night armor","description":null,"created":"2023-06-06T16:47:08.246310Z","ordering":1}],"color":10253468,"thread_id":"4IFGavUP","monetization_status":"monetized"}
