With Create, the game isn't played inside a bunch of UIs, it challenges you to setup contraptions of animated components working together in many possible arrangements.</p>\n<p>Create's visual in-game documentation called 'Ponder' will guide you though all added mechanics and gadgets.</p>\n<p><strong>Important</strong>: In order to be able to see all recipes required in Create, consider installing <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/jei\">JEI</a>. The vanilla recipe book will not be able to guide you through the experience by itself.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/issues\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qPmjSXy.png\" width=\"160\" /></a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrKV2QTuyGcv4E3eSJpBiYA/playlists\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/L1bU9mr.png\" width=\"160\" /></a><a href=\"https://discord.gg/hmaD7Se\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/uf6V9ZX.png\" width=\"160\" /></a> <a href=\"https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/wiki/Supporting-the-Project\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/fHQ45KR.png\" width=\"227\" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## Development\n\n<p>Find out about supported versions and what's currently in the works in <a href=\"https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create/wiki/dev.status\">this dedicated wiki page.</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n### Developers\n\n<p>simibubi, Jozufozu, Pepper, Zelophed, gamez7, Grimmauld, Snownee</p>\n\n### Artists\n\n<p>Kryppers, voxel_dani, LeastReality, vectorwing</p>\n\n### Contributors\n\n<p>tterrag, evanthebruce, D'Arcy Olla, Kayla</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n## Localization\nLocalizations are kindly submitted from our community on CrowdIn.
