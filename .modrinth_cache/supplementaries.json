A. Q. ‚ùì</h2>\n</center>\n\nQ: How do I disable/tweak X feature?\nA: Refer to the Customization section in the [Wiki](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar/Supplementaries/wiki) or join our [Discord]()\n\nQ: Could you update/downgrade to X version?\nA: I plan to eventually port the mod to every new major Minecraft version so be patient.\nAs for downgrades absolutely no, I'm not interested in supporting older obsolete versions. Maintaining this one version already takes up so much of my time and so much changed between those versions that I would have to pretty much re-learn how to mod.\n\nQ: Could you add X feature/block?\nA: I would encourage you to join our Discord. We have a section dedicated to suggestions like that. If I'll feel like your idea fits well enough it will have a high chance to be eventually added.\n\nQ: How do I use X block/item?\nA: Once again refer to the Wiki.\n\nQ: How can I fix this issue/ crash?\nA: Please open a report in the Issues section always including a Crash Report.\n\nQ: Fabric version is missing X\nA: Supplementaries is a mainly a Forge Mod and if some feature is missing that means that it didnt have a simple or easy implementation as Fabric was missing a counterpart of something provided by Forge API that such feature was heavily reliant on.

However to view them directly in-game, insert a written Book named \"credits\" in a Notice Board.\nAlso some sounds are from Zapsplat so credit to them\n\n<center>\n\n## ‚ù§Ô∏èSupport Me‚ù§Ô∏è\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support me, you can do so here.
