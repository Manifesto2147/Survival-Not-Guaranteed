Adds an option to choose the crafting result if more than one is available.","body":"Polymorph is a mod that solves recipe conflicts by letting players choose between all potential\noutputs shared by the same ingredients.\n\nWith a sufficiently large amount of mods, recipe conflicts are a common occurrence and the\nresponsibility for resolving these usually falls on the user or modpack developer, using datapacks\nor other tools to ensure that each recipe is unique.\n\nPolymorph offers an alternative solution, allowing all possible crafting and smelting recipes to\nco-exist regardless of conflicts.\n\n## Features\n\n### Crafting\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/TkWswkG/polymorph.gif)\n\nWhen a group of ingredients matches more than one recipe, a button will appear above the output\nslot. Pushing this button will show a list of all possible results and selecting one will change the\ncrafting output to match. Polymorph will also remember the last selection as long as the ingredients\ndon't change, so repeated crafting actions are possible on the same selection.\n\n### Smelting\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/QX9MNYM/polymorph-furnacedemo.gif)\n\nWhen a valid input matches more than one output, a button will appear above the output slot. Pushing\nthis button will show a list of all possible results with the currently selected result highlighted\nin green. Selecting one of the listed results will change the smelting output to match. This\nselection will be saved to the block itself and persist across world loading and unloading.\n\n### Smithing\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/GTCgL3S/smithingconflicts.png)\n\nExactly like the crafting screen, a button will appear above the output slot when a valid input matches more than one\noutput. Upon selection, the output will change to match.\n\n### Commands\n\nTo assist identifying potential conflicts, there's a command `/polymorph conflicts` that will try to identify recipes\nthat conflict with each other and outputs a list of them to your logs folder. Currently, the command will scan crafting,\nsmelting, blasting, smoking, and smithing recipes.\n\n## Affiliates\n\n[![BisectHosting](https://i.ibb.co/1G4QPdc/bh-illusive.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/illusive)\n","body_url":null,"published":"2023-02-03T20:08:37.444573Z","updated":"2025-04-22T08:09:40.653170Z","approved":"2023-02-03T22:57:44.906156Z","queued":null,"status":"approved","requested_status":"approved","moderator_message":null,"license":{"id":"LGPL-3.0-or-later","name":"GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 only","url":null},"downloads":6193136,"followers":975,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["diy4s2XO","66Bkdq05","68l9BR3j","bT9w3gh5","hR8YtS8a","gxwQtnsA","vAv92Cl4","vuRsKlbz","cnPRpn78","tLFw14o5","haoNzeyv","750iJ3hO","rect6WEh","aYxyXMzJ","ChHxCoAb","STYYlkp8","wN8G3kAN","skUakdXR","uAleZkbS","SNlci35k","GKZ6KVfs","6Nyu412V","VQtXcHcR","bIDSNOm5","UlRasi89","l15iQHMn","AWwJD7yS","7L5hC81R","zncS6GGa","pJZr4yc3","8zhVFKEL","Sj0OPjRM","2BAp032A","FBfg7una","E4b6m0sQ","GcFD377O","km82tZAr","gXWxJGsW","Y8yR5ZhZ","qA4syOxx","akZJjqpV","iaqnjwBU","6tFcWl5d","Mq4la1Hv","W3ii0PIQ","N1NUMRCn","89IAarqG","ByjYK8ay","EYWxtHOI","V6TZ8mE6","OQP0nLJU","R9HsHDwY","GTEspIbt","wZ1N91Ci","yPIvYQkJ","QoURX3fY","3RJxqsNz","p4JIL4TF","3XAwKo9y","HpXWxhc2","WNLgny3d","9XFy7cdd","xGn4rwXN","USDMEIVG","xaTRylMN","XnckJfxp","CJo9qCQT","7HrMDnJs","lvXLiyLU","pT1H26Vj","p7pF15m3","9dCd6h4k","JJzyheLt","e9bcrAwa","Uxso6lX6","6kZfluud","q2Fuq2OB","PwXImdZm","qm2ho2dd","vS0MDXGK","IfxeQ3PR","AGMyBSJE","3WDycUwh","K5Elhq9p","57BJwR3V","SvfFwFgC","UlzntUUQ","iFhttk9P","z88tNWJh","f95jImsh","B6z3k2Bi","j4jPy88h","X9gNJacb","CmeNqxmN","Hjvt9baJ","KVZCAz9J","gfB8ozV3","CJGqahCe","T7f4yT8g","4iTfOZ4X","XlPgZaTt","oARBy1is","UZBKtFyR","BqpOAcHK","YuL8WZQ9","Ac1c8Jlj"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tagwiZkJ/ed244c5829bde539763c7fffb55cb3194a349d66.png","issues_url":"https://github.com/illusivesoulworks/polymorph/issues","source_url":"https://github.com/illusivesoulworks/polymorph","wiki_url":null,"discord_url":"https://discord.gg/JWgrdwt","donation_urls":[{"id":"ko-fi","platform":"Ko-fi","url":"https://ko-fi.com/theillusivec4"}],"gallery":[{"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tagwiZkJ/images/d6122b7dd0dc7283795513be933a544aa49c3c8d.gif","raw_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/tagwiZkJ/images/d6122b7dd0dc7283795513be933a544aa49c3c8d.gif","featured":true,"title":"Crafting Select","description":null,"created":"2023-02-03T20:15:39.087950Z","ordering":0}],"color":12895428,"thread_id":"tagwiZkJ","monetization_status":"monetized"}
